# College Dropout Model (In Progress)
This project hopes to develop a model and ML based application that will allow users to predict the probability that they will graduate or dropout of college. After the final model is developed I hope to upload the model to a simple web app that will allow students, educators or faculty to use the model to understand any potential risk when it comes to dropping out of college.

For the project, we build of the dataset provided by "Realinho, V.; Machado, J.; Baptista, L.; Martins, M.V. Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success. Data 2022, 7, 146."
